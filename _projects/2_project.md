Below is a summary of the DREAD project. The full report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPG1WcTxJh1bnaGEkQjsyuTOKujlfktjkSLCkS3Jnm8/edit?usp=sharing). If there is any trouble with the link or viewing the report. Please reach out to Carter (godincarter17@gmail.com)

The DREAD mission was my capstone design project for my undergraduate degree. I worked on a team of 5 to develop a proposal for a simulated NASA Discovery-class mission. The Discovery Mission program is used by NASA to solicit proposals for novel solutions the Agency's outstanding science objectives in the inner solar system. My team elected for a study of the composition and origin of the Martian moon Deimos by way of a novel geodyssey orbiter placed in a complex quasi-satellite orbit of the moon. 

Generally, the goal of the proposed mission was to generate a comprehensive, sub-surface density and mineral composition map of Deimos to enable future investigation of the moon's presently obscure origins. To accomplish this, the team outlined a concept for a novel reconaissance orbiter which would deploy independently-orbiting retroreflectors to be used as measurement points. These points could be remotely and precisely ranged using LIDAR and used to measure minute perturbation's in the gravity field of Deimos, in turn allowing inference about the sub-surface composition of the moon.

To tackle the problem, the team worked to first define project constraints and goals as well as planned deliverables. Following this, an action plan was developed outlining key areas of work to enable deliverables as well as defining pre-requisite relationships between tasks. With these complete, the team had a view of the problem at large, as well as a sense of the low-level effort required to complete it. Task areas were then delegated between team members based on expertise and interest, and sub-objectives to measure progress were created and aligned with the capstone design check-in schedule.

1. Draft science goals
    - Ensure science goal alignment with NASA Discovery priorities
    - Ensure alignment with course constraints.
    - Ensure feasibility with available technologies and budget.
2. Define deliverables
    - Align deliverables with science goals
    - Align deliverables with course milestones
3. Generate action plan
    - Outline core areas of effort
    - Refine core areas to low-level tasks
    - Develop minor deliverables to illustrate sub-system function
    - Develop test and integration plan for subsystems
4. Organize team
    - Assign tasking
    - Develop plan for progress tracking, check-ins
    - Establish communication norms
    - Set up shared workspaces, file-sharing
5. Execute
    - Regular check-ins with team to ensure progress
    - Regular check-ins with faculty to ensure alignment of effort with course objectives and timeliness of completion

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:
