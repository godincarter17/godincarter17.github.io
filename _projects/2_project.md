Below is a summary of the DREAD project. The full report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPG1WcTxJh1bnaGEkQjsyuTOKujlfktjkSLCkS3Jnm8/edit?usp=sharing). If there is any trouble with the link or viewing the report. Please reach out to Carter (godincarter17@gmail.com)

The DREAD mission was my capstone design project for my undergraduate degree. I worked on a team of 5 to develop a proposal for a simulated NASA Discovery-class mission, the goal of which was to solicit proposals for novel solutions the Agency's outstanding science objectives in the inner solar system. My team elected for a study of the composition and origin of the Martian moon Deimos by way of a novel geodyssey orbiter placed in a complex quasi-satellite orbit of the moon. Other examples of Discovery Class missions include the below, found [here](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/programs/discovery/):

Generally, the goal of the proposed mission was to generate a comprehensive, sub-surface density and mineral composition map of Deimos to enable future investigation of the moon's presently obscure origins. To accomplish this, the team outlined a concept for a novel reconaissance orbiter which would deploy independently-orbiting retroreflectors to be used as measurement points. These points could be remotely and precisely ranged using LIDAR and used to measure minute perturbation's in the gravity field of Deimos, in turn allowing inference about the sub-surface composition of the moon.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:
