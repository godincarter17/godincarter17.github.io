I'm Carter, a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning researcher with MIT's Lincoln Lab. I'm broadly interested in applications of data science inclusing Machine Learning (ML) techniques for: High-dimensional data analysis, inference and causality, social network mapping, as well as sociological analysis and data mining. I'm also interested in the meta-construction of related tools inclusing techniques for automated hyper-parameter tuning, and model verification/validation.

My undergraduate degree was in Aeronautical Engineering with a concentration in Space Vehicle Design. After graduation, however, I found a deep love for software and data analysis through my work with MIT's Lincoln Lab. I've taken non-matriculating graduate courses with MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) as part of the Advanced Study Program and wish to pursue these studies in the future as part of a degree-seeking graduate program. I would like to contribute to the advancement of the tools and topics I have come to love and define my work by.

In my time at Lincoln, I have both executed and led the archtitecting, testing, and deployment of many kinds of software systems. Some have been small, bespoke data analytics systems using pre-trained ML models pulled from the internet and quickly integrated and evaluated. Others have been large, enterprise-level networks of inter-dependent microservices with many streams of data ingest, tightly controlled and security-sensitive data persistence, and mission-critical, high-performance data publishing. I would like to expand this work to include novel applications of ML techniques to high-dimensional, socio-political applicaitons. My love is for the creation of accessible, socially useful machines that help people understand their world, and bring that world into focus for decision-makers.
